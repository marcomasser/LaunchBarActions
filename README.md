Create New Swift Playground
===========================

Oftentimes, I just want to try something out in a clean Playground, but switching to Xcode, creating a new Playground and (most importantly) then deciding how to name it and where to save it is just no fun for me.

That’s why I wrote a LaunchBar Action that just creates a new Playground and opens it right away. You can optionally enter a name for the Playground, but you don’t have to (a timestamped name is used by default).

It’s written in Swift, so a current Xcode version is required.
